    <h2>Why I joined Code Nation</h2>
    <p>After nearly 2 decades in healthcare I decided to change careers. Healthcare is not family friendly;
        the long unsocialable hours with a crippling healthcare system has made work/life balance incredibly
        difficult.
        As I have always had an interest in technology, I decided to look in coding, and realised there is a HUGE
        drive to not only
        get woman into tech(YES!), but there is a skill gap in tech; meaning an opportnity to learn a new skillset
        and get a job!(YES,YES!).
        Best of all?....work/life balance! (YES, YES, YES!!)
        First I needed to see if coding was for me, so I joined Codenation's Develop program back in June. Though
        the concept were hrd to grasp,
        i thoroughly enjoyed the challenge and buzz it gave me; this is definely something I can do more of!
        In the Autum of 2022, I applied for the Grayce scholership program and got in(last minute!), to commence
        onto the Master program
        in Sofeware Development to equip me with the skills to get a job as a junior software develop by the end of
        it.
